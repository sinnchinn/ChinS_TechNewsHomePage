    - comments: Your site is really nice! Your designs are very close to the prototype. I think the navbar on the desktop version is a little bit wider than the prototype though. On the tablet version, the 3 stories at the bottom are centered in their columns, but that might look a little cleaner if they were left aligned. If the padding was consistent all the way down, I think that would look really nice too, but these are minor things since the tablet version is up to our own interpretation. The mobile version is practically perfect! I think the navbar drawer is a little too wide, but that's minor. Very nicely done, Sinatha!
